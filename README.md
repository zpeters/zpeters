### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few projects.  Most recently :inbox_tray: [stashbox](https://github.com/zpeters/stashbox) which aims to be a personal "Internet Archive" and [connectwise-colure](https://github.com/zpeters/connectwise-clojure) which is a simple API module for Connectwise Manage for Clojure.  For 2021 I am focusing on learning Rust
